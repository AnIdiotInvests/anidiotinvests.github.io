    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Many online and “mostly freemium” tools that provide great value and time savings have come to my attention in the last few years. So I thought it would be a good idea to make a quick write-up on my favorites so far (With the intention of updates and adding more over time).</p>
<p>I am not affiliated with any of these sites on this list. I will not get a reward for any clicks.</p>
<h2>PortfoliosLab.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://portfolioslab.com">portfolioslab.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used to live on PortfoliosLab, it's great for backtesting a simple portfolio and for newer investors who may not yet know exactly where to begin, and who are looking to familiarize themselves with some of the lesser-known aspects of investing.</p>
<p>It's also valuable for experienced investors seeking a simple way to start backtesting their portfolio ideas. Its biggest strength lies in comparing different types of volatility and level of drawdown between assets and indexes.</p>
<h2>PortfolioVisualizer.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com">portfoliovisualizer.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PortfolioVisualizer is similar to PortfoliosLab.com, but with an older looking UI and overall vibe.. The site contains a plethora of useful tools such as portfolio backtesting, portfolio optimization, and other advanced features like <a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation">Monte Carlo simulations</a>.</p>
<h2>TradingView.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com">tradingview.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not used TradingView, you are missing out. It is a great way to not only screen different assets and crypto, but it is super nice to have a live graph feed for free without having to be logged into a brokerage account. If you are into candle sticks, this tool is hard to beat, even on some paid platforms.</p>
<h2>Etfrc.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.etfrc.com">etfrc.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ever wondered if you are buying too much of a specific sector? Or have overlap on a specific set of companies while trying to diversify with different ETFs? Well, ETFRC is the place to be. This has saved me time reading through prospectus PDFs junk on Vanguard and Fidelity screener to compare my ETF selections and allocations. It would be great if I can add more than two ETFs at a time, but that’s my only comment.</p>
<h2>Etfdb.com</h2>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://etfdb.com">etfdb.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The website has a comprehensive selection of data with access to many of the newer products and investment vehicles that may not be listed elsewhere. I find myself on this site just to see what is out there using the sorting after a quick search.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Etf.com - Similar to etfdb, but a tad bit more clunky in my opinion.</li>
<li>Marketwatch.com - I like the virtual trading games to learn and track your favorite investments.</li>
<li>Zacks.com - Really good screener, but the UI is a bit weird for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>The investing environment is constantly changing and evolving, yet I find myself constantly coming back to these tools which the basic tools in my brokerage are not enough. None of these tools are perfect, but they can provide utility for a wide range of needs from simple backtesting and comparing different investment vehicles quickly.</p>
