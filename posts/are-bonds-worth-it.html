    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Bonds can be a controversial topic for some and have historically been used as a defensive play for more standard portfolios. However, a common question that I have seen (and asked myself) is whether or not bonds are worth owning in more modern portfolios, especially if you are younger.</p>
<p>Something you may want to consider though is that there are several different types of bonds, and you can obtain exposure to most of them inside of popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds.</p>
<h2>Using the BND ETF as an Example</h2>
<p>I used a popular ETF called <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/bnd">Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)</a> which follows the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index to represent bonds in comparison to the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500). This is not meant to deter the use of or argue the validity of bonds, but to give a visual for long-term performance.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what is inside BND, and hopefully, gain a slightly better understanding of bonds and the different forms they can take.</p>

<p>I am focusing on the ‘Distribution by credit quality because I feel this is the most important at the start. Simply put, the credit quality of a bond refers to the odds of collecting the yield from the bond issuer. In other words, this is a loose way to judge the risk of the underlying bond where the AAA rating is the lowest risk and the highest credit quality, while D represents the highest risk with the lowest credit quality.</p>
<p>When considering bonds with lower ratings and higher risk, they can sometimes be rewarded with higher potential returns. Also on a side note, When you are at or lower than BB rating, that is considered a ‘junk bond’. This is not to be insulting to the bond, it’s only the commonly used jargon.</p>
<p>Another consideration to keep in mind is that you could hypothetically create your portfolio of only AAA and treasury-rated bonds for the lowest risk possible. In this case, your returns would likely be much smaller in contrast to something like the S&amp;P 500. Although, if your time horizon is very short, this may not matter to you.</p>
<h2>Short Answer, Even in Today's Market Bonds Are Useful For Some People.</h2>
<p>The most common argument is to use bonds to lower your volatility and set a more fixed income payment for older investors. Particularly for those looking to retire sooner than later.</p>
<p>Another common rationale for bonds is for extremely risk-averse investors. The lower risk associated with bonds can also be used in tandem with a well-diversified stock portfolio to tune it to the individual's risk tolerance. The biggest question to ask yourself however is whether the potential to make less, in the long run, is worth the potential safety that bonds may provide.</p>
<p>I feel these points only apply to higher credit rating bonds with lower risk though. Lower rating junk bonds may not fulfill this role well or at all. You also need to ask yourself if you feel the corporation or government you are purchasing the bond from is good for the money in your personal opinion, not so simply trust the credit rating alone.</p>
<h2>Longer Answer, What is Your Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon?</h2>
<p>No one likes to watch their investments sink like a rock. When the market is going through a correction many people cannot help but feel sick to their stomach. Except for masochists maybe, but for the majority of people, it is probably a solid dislike of losing money. So anyone with a normal sentiment for making money would likely ask how they can still have returns from their investments with less downside long-term and short-term. Well, this is where bonds come into the picture.</p>
<p>To start we first need to understand volatility. I will not use any math, I promise! Essentially for the average Joe, volatility can be summed up with “how quickly and how much will my asset go up and down in price”. This is HEAVILY simplified, but we are trying to avoid complexity here. Now that you have that in your head when you compare BND and S&amp;P 500 you can see that S&amp;P 500 goes up and down a lot, while BND has not done much in quite some time. So clearly S&amp;P 500 is vastly more volatile than BND.</p>
<p>This means the more BND (or the combination of bonds in the index BND is following) you add to your portfolio the less volatile the overall portfolio becomes. I would highly recommend reading “The Intelligent Investor&quot;, It goes into serious depth on portfolio allocations that you cannot get from a blog post.</p>
<p>Overall if you are severely averse to volatility and downside, then adding bonds to your portfolio might be a good idea. Assuming you are also ok with giving up the potential long-term and short-term upside in advance.</p>
<p>That said, if you have an extremely long time horizon, you may look back on your 100% bond portfolio and severely regret it if the stock market and real estate continue to perform well for the next several decades. In other words, it is best to strike a balance between risky and less risky assets for a smoother ride based on your risk tolerance.</p>
