        </div>
        <div><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I have found that many people (mostly people over the age of 45 and myself included for a long time) are not aware that investing automation exists, not even talking about AI yet, just self-directed portfolios and robo advisors.</p>
<p>Yes really. And I don't think they should be ashamed of it, it's not taught anywhere.</p>
<p>If you are not aware, you can have most if not all of your investments fully automated down to the specific day you want to move your money in and out of brokerage accounts. There are limitations if you don’t know where to go or what you are looking for though.</p>
<h2>What Is Investing Automation?</h2>
<p>The process of automating your investments is exactly what it sounds like. Beyond the obvious though, there are different ways you can automate your investments which some platforms and apps do not support while others thrive on.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have some money saved up and you want to invest $50 into Google stock every week, but Google stock costs well over 1,000, so how is this possible?</p>
<p>This is where something called fractional shares come into play. Investing in fractional shares allows you to get some skin in the game without having to have tons of money to get started.</p>
<p>Sadly, several popular investing platforms do not allow automated investing in individual stocks or let alone fractional stock shares at all. This is changing though.</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, Fidelity and Vanguard used to be examples of platforms that will not allow automated investments into individual stocks or ETFs and only allow mutual fund automation for investments outside of robo advisors. There is nothing objectively wrong with this, but it could hinder your ability to automate depending on your strategy.</p>
<h2>Why Automate Your Investments?</h2>
<p>Automating your investing strategy has many benefits, but there are two main reasons I use automation.</p>
<h3>1. Save Time</h3>
<p>If you have multiple platforms, and you are investing in small chunks daily, the time it takes to log in and purchase can add up over time.</p>
<p>5 min a day X 5 days a wk X 52 wks a yr = roughly 21.66 hrs (exclude holidays obviously)</p>
<p>I know you could download an investing application on your phone, simply click a few buttons, and be done with it. This might only take you one minute a day.</p>
<p>While this is a good point, I don’t like having direct access to my assets through my smartphone. But if you like to have fine-tuned control on a day-to-day basis then automation may not be for you.</p>
<h3>2. Reduce Anxiety</h3>
<p>I cringe to the deepest part of my soul when looking at stock market charts and prices during volatile times and bear markets.</p>
<p>I already have enough stress to deal with in the world. So the act of having an application buy my favorite investment vehicles saves me from unwarranted tension.</p>
<p>It also saves me the heartache of potentially forgetting to invest or having to log in and worry about money during a vacation.</p>
<h2>What You Might Look For</h2>
<h3>Time To Purchase The Investment</h3>
<p>The most obvious thing to consider is the continual purchasing and repurchasing of the investments you like.</p>
<p>Some apps will only purchase the investments when the market opens, while others when it closes. Some will let you choose when, but not all.</p>
<p>This can reduce the liquidity of your investments and I would recommend double-checking before dumping your money in.</p>
<h3>Rebalancing</h3>
<p>Rebalancing is the act of selling or buying different positions in your portfolio to bring the allocation percentages back to your original or new goals.</p>
<p>I don’t do this by selling personally, but many professionals swear by this. Some go as far as to rebalance monthly, which would be a pain to do manually.</p>
<h3>Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)</h3>
<p>If you are not aware of DRIP, it’s simply an automated way from an app to take the earnings given to you for owning the investment and buy more of that investment with it.</p>
<p>When your investments pay you dividends, if you don’t need that money now it’s heavily recommended to reinvest it so that your investments grow faster.</p>
<p>Some platforms don’t let you automate this at all, which is a shame. While some platforms allow DRIP, but then you also cannot choose where the drip goes, they only allow you to invest in the same asset that the returns came from.</p>
<h2>My Fav Apps to Automate My Investments</h2>
<p>There are a ton of different investing apps, and I have not had nearly enough time to try them all. Of the apps I have tried, only three of them could automate to the degree that I desired, and I only liked two of them honestly.</p>
<h3>1. M1 Finance</h3>
<p>M1 Finance is easy to use, and you can build what is called a ‘Pie’. Which is simply a pie chart that represents your investment allocations.</p>
<p>The pies and rebalancing are quite easy to understand, granted the first time you set up a pie it may feel overwhelming because there are so many different ETFs to choose from.</p>
<p>I avoid the ‘professionally’ created pies, but please keep in mind I am a degenerate who donates his cash to Wall Street regularly.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of brokers do not allow automatic investments into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and instead only allow mutual funds. This is not a huge issue for some because many people don't care about the differences between ETFs and mutual funds.</p>
<p>But this is one of the biggest reasons I moved from Ally Invest over to M1 Finance. I know that the Robo Investing for Ally has ETFs, but the way it’s implemented is a bit too restrictive for me.</p>
<p>I invest in both, but I like some of the benefits of ETFs over mutual funds in specific situations. In contrast, however, you cannot invest in mutual funds on M1 Finance. On top of that, you cannot choose what time of day to purchase your investments, it's either 9 am for the free account or optionally 3 pm for the M1+ account.</p>
<h3>2. Fidelity</h3>
<p>Fidelity was the first brokerage I ever used, but not because I chose to. My job flung it upon me ready or not. I'm thankful for that period though. The new platform I am forced to use is hideous at best, but I will spare you the details.</p>
<p>For Fidelity, the UI is weird for me at times, but overall it is easy to use.</p>
<p>Honestly, I have not tried the robo advisor ‘Fidelity Go’ and I don’t plan to based on the way I use Fidelity. I manually buy my speculative investments and then automate them with DRIP.</p>
<h2>My Future Plans For Automation</h2>
<p>At the moment I use M1 Finance for a large portion of automated investments and use Fidelity for my more speculative gambling... *cough* *cough* I mean investments that are purchased manually then I use a DRIP.</p>
<p>I am possibly leaving Fidelity shortly for something else. Not sure yet, because I can’t contribute more to my 401k and my job dictates what I can and cannot invest in there.</p>
<p>Then my Roth IRA is in M1 Finance which I am quite happy with currently.</p>
<p>For my more speculative and alternative investing strategies (which only represent about 10% or less of my net worth at any given time), I might move to a different platform and strategy that allows for more automation over Fidelity.</p>
<p>Some of the platforms I'm looking into include Public, Charles Schwab, Wealthfront, and SoFi.</p>
