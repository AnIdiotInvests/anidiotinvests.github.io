            <div><span class="spec-text">AI Is Hungry For Energy</span></div>
        </div>
        <div><h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trying to find valuable articles on topics other than AI and tech is a bit annoying.</li>
<li>Will the energy needed to continue training AI grow? Or will that resource usage for AI plateau?</li>
<li>What is the possibility of this energy need not  <strong>already</strong> being fully priced in?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bombarded By AI Articles</h2>
<p>I don't try to beat the overall market by researching well-known trends. Deep down, I know I'm competing with large investing entities like hedge funds and people much smarter than myself, for limited, ever-changing information that they can get much sooner than any mainstream source.</p>
<p>That being said.</p>
<p>As I continue researching, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/artificial-intelligence-statistics">there is a never ending flow of articles about businesses adopting AI</a> and its ever growing resource “needs.” (Many of which are written by AI ironically.)</p>
<p>More specifically, the <a href="https://observer.com/2024/06/elon-musk-xai-big-tech-data-center-location/">massive data centers</a> and the <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-energy-use">insane amount of energy needed</a> to train and then run the AI. One article even claiming you would need <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption">“to watch 1,625,000 hours to consume the same amount of power it takes to train GPT-3.”</a></p>
<p>And that’s just GPT-3…</p>
<p>Not to mention all the news about possible <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/nuclear-sp500-stocks-start-2024-with-a-bang-840-million-government-contract/">nuclear reactor deals</a> and more massive data centers in the works.</p>
<p>Depending on the social media platform, it has become a bit cliche to invest in data centers and nuclear energy-related equities.</p>
<p>Yet, this hasn't stopped me from being interested in it.</p>
<h2>The Focus</h2>
<p>My focus is mostly on the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z">energy needs for training</a> and the idea that power usage is not linear. It is exponential, and companies seem to be ok with footing the bill so far. This would indicate an investment in energy and data center equities could still be a good idea, even after all the hype.</p>
<p>However, the question I still have in the back of my mind is once the AI is “trained” to the point it's considered “profitable,” will there still be a need for the vast amounts of exponentially growing energy?</p>
<p>This also <strong>assumes</strong> AI will be or remain profitable while also remaining power hungry. Another way to put it, will AI always need endless amounts of energy or will it eventually plateau?</p>
<p>While I personally don't have enough confidence to manually tilt my portfolio in the direction of AI and energy, if it does plateau, obviously investment no bueno.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I don’t see an end to the demand or potential profit.</p>
