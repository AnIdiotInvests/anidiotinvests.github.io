Take a look at [SGOV](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf) for short-term bonds and [FDLXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31617H300) for a Treasury-only money market fund. These are great places to park cash while you're waiting to buy the dipâ€”or possibly TACO. Both options offer relatively low risk and high liquidity, making them suitable for short-term strategies.
